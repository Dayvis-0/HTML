        <h2>What is a table?</h2>
        <p>
            A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). 
            A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind
            of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their 
            age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
        </p>
        <h2>How does a table work?</h2>
        <p>
            The point of a table is that it is rigid. Information is easily interpreted by 
            making visual associations between row and column headers. Look at the table below 
            for example and find a Jovian gas giant with 62 moons. You can find the answer by 
            associating the relevant row and column headers.

        <h3>When shoul you avoid HTML tables</h3>
        <p>
            In short, using tables for layout rather than CSS layout techniques is a bad idea. 
            The main reasons are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users:</strong> 
                    screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an 
                    HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the
                    right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout 
                    techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tables produce tag soup:</strong>As mentioned above, table layouts 
                    generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. 
                    This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tables are not automatically responsive:</strong> When you use proper 
                    layout containers (such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt</code>;, 
                    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>), their width defaults 
                    to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according
                    to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout
                    styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Creating your first table</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags: <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code>. Add these inside the body of your HTML.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created with
                    a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> element ("td" stands for "table data"). Add the 
                    following inside your table tags:
                </p>
                <div class="box1">
                    <table>
                        <td>Hi, I'im your first cell</td>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If we want a row of four cells, we need to copy these tags three times. Update
                    the contents of your table to look like so:
                </p>
                <div class="box1">
                    <table>
                        <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
                        <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
                        <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
                        <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As you will see, the cells are not placed underneath each other, rather they are 
            automatically aligned with each other on the same row. Each <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> 
            element creates a single cell and together they make up the first row. Every cell 
            we add makes the row grow longer.
        </p>
        <p>
            To stop this row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, 
            we need to use the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> element ('tr' stands for 'table row'). 
            Let's investigate this now.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place the four cells you've already created inside <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> tags, like so:
                </p>
                <div class="box1">
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
                            <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
                            <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
                            <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Now you've made one row, have a go at making one or two more — each row 
                    needs to be wrapped in an additional <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> element, with
                    each cell contained in a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.
                </p>
                <div class="box1">
                    <table>
                        <table>

                    </table>
                </div>

        <h3>Adding headers with <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements</h3>
        <p>
            Now let's turn our attention to table headers — special cells that go at the start of
            a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains (as an example,
            see the "Person" and "Age" cells in the first example shown in this article). To 
            illustrate why they are useful, have a look at the following table example. First 
            the source code:
        </p>
        <div class="box2">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>Knocky</td>
                    <td>Flor</td>
                    <td>Ella</td>
                    <td>Juan</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Breed</td>
                    <td>Jack Russell</td>
                    <td>Poodle</td>
                    <td>Streetdog</td>
                    <td>Cocker Spaniel</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Age</td>
                    <td>16</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Owner</td>
                    <td>Mother-in-law</td>
                    <td>Me</td>
                    <td>Me</td>
                    <td>Sister-in-law</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Eating Habits</td>
                    <td>Eats everyone's leftovers</td>
                    <td>Nibbles at food</td>
                    <td>Hearty eater</td>
                    <td>Will eat till he explodes</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>
            The problem here is that, while you can kind of make out what's going on, it is not
            as easy to cross reference data as it could be. If the column and row headings stood
            out in some way, it would be much better.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding headers to the dogs table</h3>
        <p>
            Now we'd like you to have a go at improving the dogs table example by adding some headers.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you
                    can use the <code>&lt;<strong>th</strong>&gt;</code> element ("th" stands for
                    "table header"). This works in exactly the same way as a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, 
                    except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. Go into your HTML, and change 
                    all the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements surrounding the table headers into 
                    <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Save your HTML and load it in a browser, and you should see that the headers
                    now look like headers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <div class="box2">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                        <th>Knocky</th>

                        <td>Hearty eater</td>
                        <td>Will eat till he explodes</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why are headers useful?</h3>
        <p>
            We have already partially answered this question — it is easier to find the data you
            are looking for when the headers clearly stand out, and the design just generally 
            looks better.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Table headings come with some default styling — they are bold and 
            centered even if you don't add your own styling to the table, to help them stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tables headers also have an added benefit — along with the <code>scope</code> attribute (which 
            we'll learn about in the next article), they allow you to make tables more accessible
            by associating each header with all the data in the same row or column. Screen readers
            are then able to read out a whole row or column of data at once, which is pretty useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Allowing cells to span multiple rows and columns</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes we want cells to span multiple rows or columns. Take the following simple 
            example, which shows the names of common animals. In some cases, we want to show the
            names of the males and females next to the animal name. Sometimes we don't, and in 
            such cases we just want the animal name to span the whole table.
        </p>
        <p>The initial markup looks like this:</p>
        <div class="box3">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Animals</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Hippopotamus</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Horse</th>
                    <td>Mare</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stallion</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Crocodile</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Chicken</th>
                    <td>Hen</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rooster</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <h3>Fixing the layout with <code>rowspan</code> and <code>colspan</code></h3>
        <p>
            We need a way to get "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and "Crocodile" to span across two 
            columns, and "Horse" and "Chicken" to span downwards over two rows. Fortunately, 
            table headers and cells have the <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code> attributes, 
            which allow us to do just those things. Both accept a unitless number value, which equals 
            the number of rows or columns you want spanned. For example, <code>colspan="2"</code> 
            makes a cell span two columns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's use <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code> to improve this table.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use <code>colspan</code> to make "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and "Crocodile" span 
                    across two columns.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next, use <code>colspan</code> to make "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and 
                    "Crocodile" span across two columns.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally, use <code>rowspan</code> to make "Horse" and "Chicken" span across two rows.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="box3">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="2">Animals</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="2">Hippopotamus</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th rowspan="2">Horse</th>
                    <td>Mare</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stallion</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="2">Crocodile</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th rowspan="2">Chicken</th>
                    <td>Hen</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rooster</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>  
        <h3>Grouping columns with <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;col&gt;</code></h3>
        <p>
            As you get more experience with creating HTML tables, you'll find that applying a background
            color, for example, to every cell in a single column is harder than you might think. The 
            <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements provide a solution to this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> element should be included as a child of the table, 
            just after the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code><code>&lt;/code&gt;</code> element.
            Inside the <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code><code>&lt;/code&gt;</code> element you can 
            include one or more <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements, which represent groups of 
            columns. The <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> element can include a span attribute that 
            indicates the number of columns in that group. It can also include global attributes
            such as style (if you want to target the group with inline styles) or class (if you
            want to target that group with CSS or JavaScript using a class name). The
            <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements represent the table columns from the start of the 
            columns, for example from the left hand side of a table written in a left-to-right 
            language such as English.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's have a look at an example to show what we mean. The following table shows a 
            school timetable:
        </p>
        <div class="box2">
            <h1 style="color: #000000;">School language timetable</h1>

        <p>Looking at the <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The first one has <code>span="2"</code> set on it, so it represents the first 
                    and second columns from the left of the table. We are not targeting these
                    columns with any styles, but we need to include it so that we can target 
                    subsequent columns.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The second and fourth ones don't have a <code>span</code> attribute set, so they 
                    will represent a single column — the third and fifth columns in these cases. 
                    They have a <code>class</code> of <code>column-background</code> applied.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The third one doesn't have a <code>span</code> attribute set, and has a 
                    <code>class</code> of <code>column-fixed-width</code> applied. It 
                    represents the fourth column.
