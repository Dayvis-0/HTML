            H43: Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in
            data tables
        </h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this technique is to associate each data cell (in a data table) 
            with the appropriate headers. This technique adds a <code>headers</code> attribute
            to each data cell (<code>td</code> element). It also adds an <code>id</code> attribute
            to any cell used as a header for other cells. The <code>headers</code> attribute of 
            a cell contains a list of the id attributes of the associated header cells. If there
            is more than one <code>id</code>, they are separated by spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            This technique is used when data cells are associated with more than one row and/or 
            one column header. This allows screen readers to speak the headers associated with
            each data cell when the relationships are too complex to be identified using the 
            <code>th</code> element alone or the th element with the <code>scope</code> attribute. 
            Using this technique also makes these complex relationships perceivable when the 
            presentation format changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This technique is not recommended for layout tables since its use implies a 
            relationship between cells that is not meaningful when tables are used for layout.
