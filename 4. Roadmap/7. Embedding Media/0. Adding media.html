        <h1>Adding media</h1>
        <p>
            Embedding media in HTML involves integrating multimedia content like images, audio, 
            and video directly into a webpage. This allows users to view or listen to these 
            elements without having to download them separately or navigate to another site. 
            HTML provides specific elements, such as `<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>`, 
            `<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>`, and `<code>&lt;video&gt;</code>`, to facilitate this 
            embedding process, along with attributes to control their appearance and behavior.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding images</h2>
        <p>
            To add images to a page, we use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> inline element. The 
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which 
            means that it doesn’t wrap any other content and it exists as a single tag. For the
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to work, a src attribute and value must be included
            to specify the source of the image. The src attribute value is a URL, typically 
            relative to the server where a website is hosted.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conjunction with the <code>src</code> attribute, the <code>alt</code> (alternative
            text) attribute, which describes the contents of an image, should be applied. The 
            <code>code</code> attribute value is picked up by search engines and assistive 
            technologies to help convey the purpose of an image. The <code>alt</code> text will 
            be displayed in place of the image if for some reason the image is not available.
        </p>

        <h4>Supported Image Formats</h4>
        <p>
            Images come in a variety of different file formats, and each browser may support (or
            not support) different formats. By and large, the most commonly supported formats 
            online are <code>gif</code>, <code>jpg</code>, and <code>png</code> images. Of these,
            the most widely used formats today are <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code>. The
            <code>jpg</code> format provides quality images with high color counts while 
            maintaining a decent file size, ideal for faster load times. The <code>png</code> 
            format is great for images with transparencies or low color counts. We most commonly
            see <code>jpg</code> images used for photographs and <code>png</code> images used for
            icons or background patterns.
        </p>
        <h3>Sizing images</h3>
        <p>
            It is important to identify the size of an image in order to tell the browser how large 
            the image should be before the page even loads; thus the browser can reserve space for 
            the image and render the page faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifying either a <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> will cause the other dimension
            to adjust automatically to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. As an example, if we
            want an image to be <code>200</code> pixels tall but are less specifically concerned 
            about how wide it is, we can set the <code>height</code> to <code>200</code> pixels, and
            the <code>width</code> of the image will adjust accordingly. Setting both a <code>width</code> 
            and <code>height</code> will work also; however, doing so may break the aspect ratio of 
            an image, causing it to appear distorted.
        </p>

        <h3>Positioning Images</h3>
        <p>
            We can use a number of different approaches to position images on a web page. By default
            images are positioned as inline-level elements; however, their positions may be changed 
            using CSS, specifically the <code>float</code>, <code>display</code>, and box model 
            properties, including <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>Inline Positioning Images</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is by default an inline-level element. Adding an 
            image without any styles to a page will position that image within the same line as the
            content that surrounds it. Additionally, the height of the line in which an image appears
            will be changed to match the height of the image, which can create large vertical gaps 
            within that line.

        </p>
        <h3>Block Positioning Images</h3>
        <p>
            Adding the display property to an image and setting its value to block forces the image 
            to be a block-level element. This makes the image appear on its own line, allowing the 
            surrounding content to be positioned above and below the image.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Positioning Images Flush Left or Right</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes displaying an image as <code>inline</code> or <code>block</code>, or perhaps 
            even <code>inline-block</code>, isn’t ideal. We may want the image to appear on the left
            or right side of its containing element, while all of the other content wraps around the
            image as necessary. To do this, we use the <code>float</code> property with a value of 
            either <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>When to Use an Image Element vs. a Background Image</h4>
        <p>
            There are two primary ways to add images to a web page. One way, as covered here, is to 
            use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element within HTML. Another way is to use the <code>background</code>
            or <code>background-image</code> property within CSS to assign a background image to an 
            element. Either option will do the job; however, they each have specific use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>img</code> element within HTML is the preferred option when the image being
            used holds semantic value and its content is relevant to the content of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code> property within CSS is the 
            preferred option when the image being used is part of the design or user interface of the page. As such, it’s not directly relevant to the content of the page.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding Audio</h2>
        <p>
            HTML5 provides a quick and easy way to add audio files to a website by way of the 
            <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element. As with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, the
            <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element accepts a source URL specified by the src attribute. 
            Unlike the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, though, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element
            requires both opening and closing tags, which we’ll discuss soon.
        </p>
        <audio src="Audios/jazz.ogg"></audio>
        <h3>Audio Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            Several other attributes may accompany the src attribute on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> 
            element; the most popular include <code>autoplay</code>, <code>controls1</code>, 
            <code>loop</code>, and <code>preload</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>autoplay</code>, <code>controls</code>, and loop attributes are all Boolean 
            attributes. As Boolean attributes, they don’t require a stated value. Instead, when 
            each is present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element its value will be set to true, 
            and the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element will behave accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element isn’t displayed on a page. If the 
            <code>autoplay</code> Boolean attribute is present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> 
            element, nothing will appear on the page, but the audio file will automatically play 
            upon loading.
        </p>
        <!--<audio src="Audios/jazz.ogg" autoplay></audio>-->
        <audio src="Audios/jazz.ogg"></audio>
        <p>
            To display the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element on a page, the controls Boolean 
            attribute is necessary. When it’s applied to the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, 
            the <code>controls</code> Boolean attribute will display a browser’s default audio 
            controls, including play and pause, seek, and volume controls.
        </p>
        <audio src="Audios/jazz.ogg" controls></audio>
        <p>
            When present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, the <code>loop</code> Boolean
            attribute will cause an audio file to repeat continually, from beginning to end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the <code>preload</code> attribute for the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element
            helps identify what, if any, information about the audio file should be loaded before
            the clip is played. It accepts three values: <code>none</code>, <code>auto</code>, 
            and <code>metadata</code>.  The <code>none</code> value won’t preload any information
            about an audio file, while the auto value will preload all information about an audio
            file. The <code>metadata </code> value sits in between the <code>none</code> and
            <code>auto</code> values, as it will preload any available metadata information about 
            an audio file, such as the clip’s length, but not all information.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the <code>preload</code> attribute isn’t present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> 
            element, all information about an audio file is loaded, as if the value was set to 
            <code>auto</code>. For this reason, using the <code>preload</code> attribute with a
            value of <code>metadata</code> or <code>none</code> is a good idea when an audio file
            is not essential to a page. It’ll help to conserve bandwidth and allow pages to load faster.
        </p>
        <h3>Audio Fallbacks & Multiple Sources</h3>
        <p>
            At the moment, different browsers support different audio file formats, the three most
            popular of which are <code>ogg</code>, <code>mp3</code>, and <code>wav</code>. For the 
            best browser support we’ll need to use a handful of audio fallbacks, which will be 
            included inside an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element’s opening and closing tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, we’ll remove the src attribute from the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element. 
            Instead, we’ll use the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element, with a src attribute, nested
            inside the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element to define a new source.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element and <code>src</code> attribute for each file
            format, we can list one audio file format after the other. We’ll use the <code>type</code>
            attribute to quickly help the browser identify which audio types are available. When a 
            browser recognizes an audio file format it will load that file and ignore all the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it was introduced in HTML5, some browsers may not support the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>
            element. In this case, we can provide a link to download the file after any
            <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements within the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="Audios/jazz.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
            <source src="Audios/jazz.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            <source src="Audios/jazz.wav" type="audio/wav">
            Please <a href="Audio/jazz.mp3" download>download</a> the audio file
        </audio>
        <p>
            To review the previous code, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element includes the <code>controls</code> 
            Boolean attribute to ensure the audio player is displayed within browsers that support
            the element. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element does not include a <code>src</code>
            attribute and instead wraps three different <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements. Each 
            <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element includes a <code>src</code> attribute that 
            references a different audio file format and a <code>type</code> attribute to identify
            the format of the audio file. As a last fallback, if a browser doesn’t recognize any of
             the audio file formats, the anchor link to download the element will be displayed.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding Video</h2>
        <p>
            Adding video in HTML5 is very similar to adding audio. We use the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
            element in place of the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element. All of the same attributes (<code>src</code>, 
            <code>autoplay</code>, <code>controls</code>, <code>loop</code>, and <code>preload</code>) 
            and fallbacks apply here, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, if the <code>controls</code> Boolean 
            attribute isn’t specified the audio clip isn’t displayed. With videos, if the 
            <code>controls</code> Boolean attribute is not specified the video will display. 
            However, it is fairly difficult to view unless the <code>autoplay</code> Boolean attribute is 
            also applied. In general, the best practice here is to include the <code>controls</code> 
            Boolean attribute unless there is a good reason not to allow users to start, stop, or 
            replay the video.
        </p>
        <video src="Videos/pokemon.ogv" controls></video>
        <h3>Poster Attribute</h3>
        <p>
            One additional attribute available for the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is the 
            poster attribute. The poster attribute allows us to specify an image, in the form of 
            a URL, to be shown before a video is played.
        </p>
        <video src="Videos/pokemon.ogv" controls poster="Images/pokemon.jpg"></video>
        <h3>Video Fallbacks</h3>
        <p>
            As with the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, video fallbacks are also necessary. 
            The same markup format, with multiple <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements for each
            file type and a plain text fallback, also applies within the 
            <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <video controls>
            <source src="Videos/pokemon.ogv" type="video/ogv">
            <source src="Videos/pokemon.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Please <a href="Video/pokemon.mp4" download>download</a> the video.
        </video>
        <h2>Adding Inline Frames</h2>
        <p>
            Another way to add content to a page is to embed another HTML page within the current
            page. This is done using an inline frame, or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. The
            <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element accepts the URL of another HTML page within the 
            <code>src</code> attribute value; this causes the content from the embedded HTML page 
            to be displayed on the current page. The value of the <code>src</code> attribute may 
            be a URL relative to the page the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element appears on or 
            an absolute URL for an entirely external page.
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed"></iframe>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element has a few default styles, including an inset
            <code>border</code> and a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. These styles 
            can be adjusted using the <code>frameborder</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>
            HTML attributes or by using the <code>border</code>, <code>width</code>, and 
            <code>height</code> CSS properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pages referenced within the <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> 
            element play by their own rules, as they do not inherit any styles or behaviors from 
            the page they are referenced on. Any styles applied to a page that includes an 
            <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element will not be inherited by the page referenced 
            within the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. Additionally, links within the page 
            referenced within the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element will open inside that frame, 
            leaving the page that contains the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element unchanged.
        </p>
        <h2>Semantically Identifying Figures & Captions</h2>
        <p>
            With HTML5 also came the introduction of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and 
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> elements. These elements were created to semantically
            mark up self-contained content or media, commonly with a caption. Before HTML5 this 
            was frequently done using an ordered list. While an ordered list worked, the markup 
            was not semantically correct.
        </p>
        <h3>Figure</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> block-level element is used to identify and wrap 
            self-contained content, often in the form of media. It may surround images, audio 
            clips, videos, blocks of code, diagrams, illustrations, or other self-contained 
            media. More than one item of self-contained content, such as multiple images or 
            videos, may be contained within the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element at a 
            time. If the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element is moved from the main portion 
            of a page to another location (for example, the bottom of the page), it should 
            not disrupt the content or legibility of the page.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="img-dog-supported" src="Images/dog.jpg" alt="A black, brown, and white dog wearing a kerchief">
        </figure>
        <h3>Figure caption</h3>
        <p>
            To add a caption or legend to the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, the 
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element is used. The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> 
            may appear at the top of, bottom of, or anywhere within the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> 
            element; however, it may only appear once. When it’s used, the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> 
            element will serve as the caption for all content within the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> 
            element.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element may replace an 
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element’s alt attribute if the content of the 
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element provides a useful description of the visual 
            content of the image.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="Images/dog.jpg">
            <figcaption>A beautiful black, brown, and white hound dog wearing kerchief.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Not all forms of media need to be included within a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element
            or include a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element; only those that are self-contained 
            and belong together as a group.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Alongside text, media is one of the largest parts of the web. Use of images, audio, 
            and video has only grown over recent years, and it isn’t likely to slow down. Now we
            know how to incorporate these forms of media into our designs and how we can use 
            them to enrich the content on our websites.
