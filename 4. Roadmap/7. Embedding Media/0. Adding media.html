    <h1>Adding media</h1>
    <p>
        Embedding media in HTML involves integrating multimedia content like images, audio, 
        and video directly into a webpage. This allows users to view or listen to these 
        elements without having to download them separately or navigate to another site. 
        HTML provides specific elements, such as `<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>`, 
        `<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>`, and `<code>&lt;video&gt;</code>`, to facilitate this 
        embedding process, along with attributes to control their appearance and behavior.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding images</h2>
    <p>
        To add images to a page, we use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> inline element. The 
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which 
        means that it doesn’t wrap any other content and it exists as a single tag. For the
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to work, a src attribute and value must be included
        to specify the source of the image. The src attribute value is a URL, typically 
        relative to the server where a website is hosted.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conjunction with the <code>src</code> attribute, the <code>alt</code> (alternative
        text) attribute, which describes the contents of an image, should be applied. The 
        <code>code</code> attribute value is picked up by search engines and assistive 
        technologies to help convey the purpose of an image. The <code>alt</code> text will 
        be displayed in place of the image if for some reason the image is not available.
    </p>

    <h4>Supported Image Formats</h4>
    <p>
        Images come in a variety of different file formats, and each browser may support (or
        not support) different formats. By and large, the most commonly supported formats 
        online are <code>gif</code>, <code>jpg</code>, and <code>png</code> images. Of these,
        the most widely used formats today are <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code>. The
        <code>jpg</code> format provides quality images with high color counts while 
        maintaining a decent file size, ideal for faster load times. The <code>png</code> 
        format is great for images with transparencies or low color counts. We most commonly
        see <code>jpg</code> images used for photographs and <code>png</code> images used for
        icons or background patterns.
    </p>
    <h3>Sizing images</h3>
    <p>
        It is important to identify the size of an image in order to tell the browser how large 
        the image should be before the page even loads; thus the browser can reserve space for 
        the image and render the page faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifying either a <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> will cause the other dimension
        to adjust automatically to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. As an example, if we
        want an image to be <code>200</code> pixels tall but are less specifically concerned 
        about how wide it is, we can set the <code>height</code> to <code>200</code> pixels, and
        the <code>width</code> of the image will adjust accordingly. Setting both a <code>width</code> 
        and <code>height</code> will work also; however, doing so may break the aspect ratio of 
        an image, causing it to appear distorted.
    </p>

    <h3>Positioning Images</h3>
    <p>
        We can use a number of different approaches to position images on a web page. By default
        images are positioned as inline-level elements; however, their positions may be changed 
        using CSS, specifically the <code>float</code>, <code>display</code>, and box model 
        properties, including <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Inline Positioning Images</h3>
    <p>
        The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is by default an inline-level element. Adding an 
        image without any styles to a page will position that image within the same line as the
        content that surrounds it. Additionally, the height of the line in which an image appears
        will be changed to match the height of the image, which can create large vertical gaps 
        within that line.

    </p>
    <h3>Block Positioning Images</h3>
    <p>
        Adding the display property to an image and setting its value to block forces the image 
        to be a block-level element. This makes the image appear on its own line, allowing the 
        surrounding content to be positioned above and below the image.

    </p>
    <h3>Positioning Images Flush Left or Right</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes displaying an image as <code>inline</code> or <code>block</code>, or perhaps 
        even <code>inline-block</code>, isn’t ideal. We may want the image to appear on the left
        or right side of its containing element, while all of the other content wraps around the
        image as necessary. To do this, we use the <code>float</code> property with a value of 
        either <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>.

    <h4>When to Use an Image Element vs. a Background Image</h4>
    <p>
        There are two primary ways to add images to a web page. One way, as covered here, is to 
        use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element within HTML. Another way is to use the <code>background</code>
        or <code>background-image</code> property within CSS to assign a background image to an 
        element. Either option will do the job; however, they each have specific use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>img</code> element within HTML is the preferred option when the image being
        used holds semantic value and its content is relevant to the content of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code> property within CSS is the 
        preferred option when the image being used is part of the design or user interface of the page. As such, it’s not directly relevant to the content of the page.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding Audio</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 provides a quick and easy way to add audio files to a website by way of the 
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element. As with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, the
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element accepts a source URL specified by the src attribute. 
        Unlike the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, though, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element
        requires both opening and closing tags, which we’ll discuss soon.
    </p>
    <audio src="jazz.ogg"></audio>
    <h3>Audio Attributes</h3>
    <p>
        Several other attributes may accompany the src attribute on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> 
        element; the most popular include <code>autoplay</code>, <code>controls1</code>, 
        <code>loop</code>, and <code>preload</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>autoplay</code>, <code>controls</code>, and loop attributes are all Boolean 
        attributes. As Boolean attributes, they don’t require a stated value. Instead, when 
        each is present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element its value will be set to true, 
        and the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element will behave accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element isn’t displayed on a page. If the 
        <code>autoplay</code> Boolean attribute is present on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> 
        element, nothing will appear on the page, but the audio file will automatically play 
        upon loading.
    </p>
    <audio src="jazz.ogg" autoplay></audio>
    <p>
        To display the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element on a page, the controls Boolean 
        attribute is necessary. When it’s applied to the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, 
        the <code>controls</code> Boolean attribute will display a browser’s default audio 
        controls, including play and pause, seek, and volume controls.
    </p>
    <audio src="jazz.ogg" controls></audio>
