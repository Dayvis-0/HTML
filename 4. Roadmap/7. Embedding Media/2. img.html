        <h1>img</h1>
        <!--El elemento HTML <img> incrusta una imagen en el documento-->
        <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> HTML element embeds an image into the document.</p>
        <img 
            class="fit-picture" 
            src="Images/grapefruit-slice.jpg" 
            alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices">
        <p>
            The above example shows usage of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <code>src</code> attribute holds the path to the image you want to embed. It is not 
                    mandatory if the <code>srcset</code> attribute is available. However, at least 
                    one of the <code>src</code> or <code>srcset</code> attributes must be provided.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <code>alt</code> attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which 
                    is mandatory and <strong>incredibly useful</strong> for accessibility — screen 
                    readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know what the image 
                    means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for 
                    some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or link rot.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use both <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to set the intrinsic size 
                    of the image, allowing it to take up space before it loads, to mitigate 
                    content layout shifts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Responsive image hints with sizes and srcset</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supported image formats</h2>
        <p>The image file formats that are most commonly used on the wed are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) — Good choice lossless animation 
                    sequences (GIF is less performat)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) — Good choice for both images and animated images
                    due to high performace.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) — Good choice for simple images and animations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    JPEG (Join Photographic Expert Group Image) — Good choice for lossy compression
                    of still images (currently the most popular). 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    PNG (Portable Network Graphics) — Good choice for lossless compression of still
                    images (slightly better quality than JPEG).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) — Vector image format. Use for images that must 
                    be drawn accurately at different sizes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>WebP (Web Picture Format) — Excellent choice for both images and animated images</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Formats like WebP and AVIF are recommended as they perform much better than PNG, 
            JPEG, GIF for both still and animated images.
        </p>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <code>alt</code>
        <p>Defines text that can replace the image in the page.</p>
        <code>crossorigin</code>
        <p>
            Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a CORS request. Image data 
            from a CORS-enabled image returned from a CORS request can be reused in the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> 
            element without being marked "tainted".
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>anonymus</code></dt>
            <dt><code>use-credentials</code></dt>
        </dl>
        <code>decoding</code>
        <p>
            This attribute provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image 
            decoding along with rendering the other DOM content in a single presentation step that 
            looks more "correct" (sync), or render and present the other DOM content first and then 
            decode the image and present it later (async).
