        <h2>How do we put an imge on a webpage?</h2>
        <p>
            In order to put an image on a web page, we use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. 
            This is a void element (meaning, it cannot have any child content and cannot have an 
            end tag) that requires two attributes to be useful: <code>src</code> and 
            <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute contains a URL pointing to 
            the image you want to embed in the page. As with the <code>href</code> attribute for
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, the <code>src</code> attribute can be a relative URL
            or an absolute URL. Without a <code>src</code> attribute, an <code>img</code> element
            has no image to load.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>alt</code> attribute is described below.</p>
        <p>
            So for example, if your image is called <code>dinosaur.jpg</code>, and it sits in the 
            same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like so:
        </p>
        <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>
            If the image was in an <code>images</code> subdirectory, which was inside the same 
            directory as the HTML page, then you'd embed it like this:
        </p>
        <img src="Images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>You could also embed the image using its absolute URL, for example:</p>
        <img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>
            Linking via absolute URLs is not recommended, however. You should host the images you 
            want to use on your site, which in simple setups means keeping the images for your 
            website on the same server as your HTML. In addition, it is more efficient to use 
            relative URLs than absolute URLs in terms of maintenance (when you move your site to a 
            different domain, you won't need to update all your URLs to include the new domain). 
            In more advanced setups, you might use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to deliver your 
            images.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong><em>Never</em> point the <code>src</code> attribute at an 
            image hosted on someone else's website <em>without permission</em>. This is called 
            "hotlinking". It is considered unethical, since someone else would be paying the 
            bandwidth costs for delivering the image when someone visits your page. It also 
            leaves you with no control over the image being removed or replaced with something 
            embarrassing.
