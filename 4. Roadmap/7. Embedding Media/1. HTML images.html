        <h1>HTML images</h1>
        <h2>How do we put an imge on a webpage?</h2>
        <p>
            In order to put an image on a web page, we use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. 
            This is a void element (meaning, it cannot have any child content and cannot have an 
            end tag) that requires two attributes to be useful: <code>src</code> and 
            <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute contains a URL pointing to 
            the image you want to embed in the page. As with the <code>href</code> attribute for
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, the <code>src</code> attribute can be a relative URL
            or an absolute URL. Without a <code>src</code> attribute, an <code>img</code> element
            has no image to load.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>alt</code> attribute is described below.</p>
        <p>
            So for example, if your image is called <code>dinosaur.jpg</code>, and it sits in the 
            same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like so:
        </p>
        <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>
            If the image was in an <code>images</code> subdirectory, which was inside the same 
            directory as the HTML page, then you'd embed it like this:
        </p>
        <img src="Images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>You could also embed the image using its absolute URL, for example:</p>
        <img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
        <p>
            Linking via absolute URLs is not recommended, however. You should host the images you 
            want to use on your site, which in simple setups means keeping the images for your 
            website on the same server as your HTML. In addition, it is more efficient to use 
            relative URLs than absolute URLs in terms of maintenance (when you move your site to a 
            different domain, you won't need to update all your URLs to include the new domain). 
            In more advanced setups, you might use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to deliver your 
            images.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong><em>Never</em> point the <code>src</code> attribute at an 
            image hosted on someone else's website <em>without permission</em>. This is called 
            "hotlinking". It is considered unethical, since someone else would be paying the 
            bandwidth costs for delivering the image when someone visits your page. It also 
            leaves you with no control over the image being removed or replaced with something 
            embarrassing.
        </p>
        <h3>Alternative text</h3>
        <p>
            The next attribute we'll look at is <code>alt</code>. Its value is supposed to be a 
            textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be 
            seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection. 
            For example, our above code could be modified like so:
        </p>
        <img 
            src="Images/dinosaur.jpg" 
            alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large heade with long sharp teeth">
        <h3>Width and height</h3>
        <p>
            You can use the width and height attributes to specify the width and height of your 
            image. They are given as integers without a unit, and represent the image's width and 
            height in pixels.
        </p>
        <img 
            src="Images/dinosaur.jpg" 
            alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large heade with long sharp teeth"
            width="400"
            height="341">
        <p>
            There's a very good reason to do this. The HTML for your page and the image are separate 
            resources, fetched by the browser as separate HTTP(S) requests. As soon as the browser 
            has received the HTML, it will start to display it to the user. If the images haven't 
            yet been received (and this will often be the case, as image file sizes are often much 
            larger than HTML files), then the browser will render only the HTML, and will update 
            the page with the image as soon as it is received.
        </p>
        <p>For example, suppose we have some text after the image:</p>
        <h1>Images in HTML</h1>
        <img
            src="Images/dinosaur.jpg"
            alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
            title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium she
            imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny,
            delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents
            and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in any case. The
            ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.
            The ocean was a world. And a world is not art. Dorothy thought about the
            living things that moved in that world: large, ruthless and hungry. Like us
            up here.

        <p>
            As soon as the browser downloads the HTML, the browser will start to display the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the image is loaded, the browser adds the image to the page. Because the image 
            takes up space, the browser has to move the text down the page, to fit the image 
            above it:
        </p>
        <img src="Images/no-size.png" width="400">
        <p>
            Moving the text like this is extremely distracting to users, especially if they have 
            already started to read it, and it also causes the browser to re-render the page, which
            is bad for performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you specify the actual size of the image in your HTML using the width and height 
            attributes, then the browser knows how much space to allow for the image, before it 
            has downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that when the image has been downloaded, the browser doesn't have to 
            move the surrounding content.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/size.png" width="400">
        <h4>Resizing images</h4>
        <p>
            Although, as we have said, it is good practice to specify the actual size of your
            images using HTML attributes, you should not use them to resize images.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you set the image size too big, you'll end up with images that look grainy, fuzzy, 
            or too small, and wasting bandwidth downloading an image that is not fitting the 
            user's needs. The image may also end up looking distorted, if you don't maintain 
            the correct aspect ratio. You should use an image editor to put your image at the 
            correct size before putting it on your webpage.
        </p>
        <p>If you do need to alter an image's size, you should use CSS instead.</p>
        <h3>Image titles</h3>
        <p>
            As with links, you can also add <code>title</code> attributes to images, to provide 
            further supporting information if needed. In our example, we could do this:
        </p>
        <img
            src="Images/dinosaur.jpg"
            alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
            width="400"
            height="341"
            title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />
        <p>
            However, this is not recommended — <code>title</code> has a number of accessibility 
            problems, mainly based around the fact that screen reader support is very unpredictable
            and most browsers won't show it unless you are hovering with a mouse (so e.g., no 
            access to keyboard users)
        </p>
        <p>
            It is better to include such supporting information in the main article text, rather 
            than attached to the image.
        </p>
        <h2>Annotating images with figures and figure captions</h2>
        <p>
            Speaking of captions, there are a number of ways that you could add a caption to go 
            with your image. For example, there would be nothing to stop you from doing this:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img
                src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
                alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
                        it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
                width="400"
                height="341" />
            <p>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is OK. It contains the content you need, and is nicely stylable using CSS. But 
            there is a problem here: there is nothing that semantically links the image to its 
            caption, which can cause problems for screen readers. For example, when you have 50 
            images and captions, which caption goes with which image?
        </p>
        <p>
            A better solution, is to use the HTML <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and 
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> elements. These are created for exactly this purpose: 
            to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the 
            caption. Our above example could be rewritten like this:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img 
                src="Images/dinosaur.jpg" 
                alt="The head and torse of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large with long sharp teeth"
                width="400"
                height="341">
                <figcaption>
                    A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element tells browsers, and assistive technology 
            that the caption describes the other content of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element.
