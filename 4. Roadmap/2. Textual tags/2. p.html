        <!--La etiqueta <p> en HTML define un párrafo. Los navegadores agregan automáticamente una única 
        linea en blanco antes y después de cada párrafo, creando una separación clara entre bloques 
        de texto. Es un elemento a nivel de bloque, lo que significa que ocupa todo el ancho disponible
        y comienza en una nueva linea.-->
        <p class="p">
            The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually 
            represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank 
            lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping 
            of related content, such as images or form fields.

        <h2>Styling paragraphs</h2>
        <p class="p-style">
            By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line. Alternate separation 
            methods, such as first-line indentation, can be achieved with CSS:
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
            Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
            they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used
            to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
        </p>

        <p class="p-style">
            Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts,
            uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works,
            combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
        </p>

        <p class="p-style">
            In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶,
            the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to
            read.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
            How hard to read? See for yourself:
            <button data-toggle-text="Oh no! Switch back!">
                Use pilcrow for paragraphs
            </button>
        </p>
        <script>
            document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
                document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((paragraph) => {
                    paragraph.classList.toggle("pilcrow");
                })

                [event.target.innerText, event.target.dataset.toggleText] = [
                    event.target.dataset.toggleText, 
                    event.target.innerText
                ];
            });
        </script>
