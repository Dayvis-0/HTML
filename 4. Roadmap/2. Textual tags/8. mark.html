        <h2>Marking text of interest</h2>
        <p>
            In this first example, a &lt;mark&gt; element is used to mark some text within a quote which is of particular interest to the user
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            It is a perid of civil wawr. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, 
            have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle,
            <mark>Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empire's ultimate 
            weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy 
            an entire planet.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This example demostrates using &lt;mark&gt; to mark search results within a passage.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Alltough the Death Star has been destroyed,
            <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> troops have driven the Rebel forces from 
            their hidden base and  pursued them across the galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evading the dreaded <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on the 
            remote ice world of Hoth.
