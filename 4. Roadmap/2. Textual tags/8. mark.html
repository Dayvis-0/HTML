        <!--El elemento HTML <mark> representa texto que ésta marcado o resaltado para fines de 
        referencia o notación debido a la relevancia del pasaje marcado en el contexto circundante.-->
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted 
            for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

            search results of "salamander"

        <hr>
        <p>
            Several species of <mark>salamander</mark>
            inhabit the temperature rainforest of the Pacific Northwest
        </p>
        <p> 
            Most <mark>salamander</mark>s are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms, and 
            other small creatures.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage notes</h2>
        <p>Thipical use cases for <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to mark passages that you 
                    find of interest.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Otherwise, <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> indicates a portion of the document's content 
                    which is likely to be relevant to the user's current activity. This might be used, 
                    for example, to indicate the words that matched a search operation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Don't use <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, 
                    use the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element with appropriate CSS applied to it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <h3>Marking text of interest</h3>
        <p>
            In this first example, a &lt;mark&gt; element is used to mark some text within a quote which is of particular interest to the user
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            It is a perid of civil wawr. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, 
            have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle,
            <mark>Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empire's ultimate 
            weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy 
            an entire planet.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Identifying context-sensitive passages</h3>
        <p>
            This example demostrates using <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> to mark search results within 
            a passage.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Alltough the Death Star has been destroyed,
            <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> troops have driven the Rebel forces from 
            their hidden base and  pursued them across the galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evading the dreaded <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on the 
            remote ice world of Hoth.
