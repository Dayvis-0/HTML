        <h1>sub</h1>
        <!--El elemento HTML <sub> especifica texto en linea que debe mostrarse como subindice por 
        razones exclusivamente tipografícas.-->
        <p>
            The <strong><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code></strong> HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed 
            as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a 
            lowered baseline using smaller text.
        </p>

            Almost every developer's favorite molecule is 
            C <sub>8</sub> H <sub>10</sub> N <sub>4</sub> O <sub>2</sub>, also known as "caffeine"
        </p>
        <h2>Usage notes</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> element should be used only for typographical reasons—that 
            is, to change the position of the text to comply with typographical conventions or 
            standards, rather than solely for presentation or appearance purposes
        </p>
        <p>
            Appropriate use cases for <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> include (but aren't necessarily 
            limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Marking up footnote numbers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Marking up the subscript in mathematical variable numbers (although you may also 
                    consider using a MathML formula for this)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula (such 
                    as every developer's best friend, C <sub>8</sub> H <sub>10</sub> N <sub>4</sub>
                    O<sub>2</sub>, otherwise known as "caffeine").
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Footnote numbers</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional footnotes are denoted using numbers which are rendered in subscript. This
            is a common use case for <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>;
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the computations by Nakmaura, Johnson, and Mason<sub>1</sub> this will
            result in the complete annihilation of both particles.
        </p>
        <h2>Variable subscripts</h2>
        <p>
            In mathematics, families of variables related to the same concept (such as distances 
            along the same axis) are represented using the same variable name with a subscript following. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
            The horizontal coordinates' positions along the X-axis are represented as
            <var>x<sub>1</sub></var> … <var>x<sub>n</sub></var>.
        </p>
        <h2>Chemical formulas</h2>
        <p>
            When writing a chemical formula, such as H2O, the number of atoms of a given element 
            within the described molecule is represented using a subscripted number; in the case 
            of water, the subscripted "2" indicates that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the 
            molecule.
        </p>

            Almost every developer's favorite molecule is
            C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is commonly known
            as "caffeine."
