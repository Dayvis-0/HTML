        <!--El elemento HTML <title> define el titulo del documento que se muestra en la barra de 
        titulo del navegador o en la pestaña de una página. -->
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown 
            in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the 
            element, if any, are also treated as plain text.

        <h3>Page title and SEO</h3>
        <p>
            The contents of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization 
            (SEO). In general, a longer, descriptive title performs better than short or generic titles. 
            The content of the title is one of the components used by search engine algorithms to decide 
            the order in which to list pages in search results.
        </p>
        <p>A few guidelines and tips for composing good titles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid one- or two-word titles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Search engines typically display about the first 55-60 characters of a page title.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't use "keyword blobs".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Try to make sure your titles are as unique as possible within your own site.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>It is important to provide an accurate and concise title to describe the page's purpose.</p>
        <p>
            Titles should be unique to every page of a website, ideally surfacing the primary purpose
            of the page first, followed by the name of the website. Following this pattern will help 
            ensure that the primary purpose of the page is announced by a screen reader first. This 
            provides a far better experience than having to listen to the name of a website before 
            the unique page title, for every page a user navigates to in the same website.
