        <h2>Footnote numbers</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional footnotes are denoted using numbers which are rendered in subscript. This
            is a common use case for <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>;
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the computations by Nakmaura, Johnson, and Mason<sub>1</sub> this will
            result in the complete annihilation of both particles.

        <h2>Variable subscripts</h2>
        <p>
            In mathematics, families of variables related to the same concept (such as distances 
            along the same axis) are represented using the same variable name with a subscript following. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
            The horizontal coordinates' positions along the X-axis are represented as
            <var>x<sub>1</sub></var> … <var>x<sub>n</sub></var>.
        </p>
        <h2>Chemical formulas</h2>
        <p>
            When writing a chemical formula, such as H2O, the number of atoms of a given element 
            within the described molecule is represented using a subscripted number; in the case 
            of water, the subscripted "2" indicates that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the 
            molecule.
